# 🧠 LLM Learning Hub — Build AI Engineer Skills (Free & Open Source)

Welcome to the **LLM Learning Hub** — a curated collection of practical, production-style notebooks built to master modern AI tools like:

- ✅ Prompt Engineering
- ✅ HuggingFace Transformers
- ✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- ✅ LLM Evaluation
- ✅ Fine-tuning models
- ✅ Computer Vision (YOLOv8)

This hub is built by an independent AI engineer, focused on becoming a full-stack LLM + ML developer ready for real-world systems, inspired by best practices from top AI teams (like OpenAI, Meta, Google).

All notebooks are:
- 100% free to run (no paid API keys required)
- Google Colab ready
- Structured for GitHub & Kaggle publishing

## 📂 Structure
Each folder contains one clean, focused notebook + README:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `prompt-engineering-cheatsheet/` | Patterns like zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, role-based prompts |
| `transformers-101/` | Basics of HuggingFace Transformers (models, tokenizers, pipelines) |
| `free-rag-faiss/` | RAG pipeline with SentenceTransformers + FAISS (no API) |
| `rag-langchain-chroma/` | RAG pipeline using LangChain + ChromaDB (fully local) |
| `fine-tune-llm-hf/` | Fine-tune transformers on your dataset with HuggingFace Trainer |
| `llm-evaluation/` | How to evaluate LLM output using metrics and scoring techniques |
| `pytorch-lightning-intro/` | Train DL models using Lightning Modules (classification example) |
| `yolov8-vision-detection/` | Object detection using YOLOv8 (images + webcam) |

## 🚀 Goals
- Build an **AI engineer portfolio** with real notebooks
- Learn to structure ML/RAG code like production teams
- Create public projects to showcase on GitHub, LinkedIn, and Kaggle
- Master free & open-source GenAI tooling

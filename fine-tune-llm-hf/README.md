## 📌 Key Highlights
| Step | What You’ll Do |
|------|-----------------|
| 1. | Load and preprocess a real-world sentiment dataset (IMDB reviews) |
| 2. | Tokenize and prepare data for training using `AutoTokenizer` |
| 3. | Fine-tune DistilBERT using HuggingFace `Trainer` framework |
| 4. | Evaluate model performance with accuracy metric |
| 5. | Test your own reviews with live predictions |

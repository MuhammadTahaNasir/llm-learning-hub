Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by enabling machines to learn, reason, and interact with humans. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models with external knowledge bases to provide accurate and context-aware responses. FAISS, developed by Facebook AI, is a highly efficient library for similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is widely used for building vector databases in RAG pipelines. HuggingFace provides open-source models like flan-t5-base, which are perfect for question answering without needing expensive APIs.

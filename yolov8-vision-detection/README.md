# 🎯 YOLOv8 Object Detection with Ultralytics

This notebook demonstrates how to run object detection on images using the latest YOLOv8 model. Built with the `ultralytics` library, it allows for fast, accurate predictions and clean integration into computer vision pipelines.

## 📌 What You’ll Do
| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. | Load a pretrained YOLOv8 model from Ultralytics |
| 2. | Perform detection on a test image |
| 3. | Visualize and save the output |
| 4. | Optionally detect objects in video streams |
| 5. | Extract bounding boxes and class labels programmatically |

---

## 🧰 Dependencies
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python-headless matplotlib
```

---

## 🖼️ Input & Output
- Input: Static image URL (`bus.jpg` from Ultralytics site)
- Output: Annotated image with bounding boxes and class labels
- Exports: `detected.jpg` + printed list of bounding box coordinates

---

## 🧪 Optional Enhancements
- Upload your own image or video
- Run frame-by-frame detection on videos
- Integrate with a webcam for real-time object tracking (local only)

---

## 🌍 Applications
- Smart surveillance & safety monitoring
- Inventory tracking in warehouses
- Autonomous driving perception layer
- Visual prompt-based agents or assistants

---

## 🧠 Part of `llm-learning-hub`
This notebook is part of a vision track under the AI Engineering portfolio series — designed to integrate with RAG, LLM, and Streamlit pipelines.

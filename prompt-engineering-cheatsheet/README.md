# ü§ñ Prompt Engineering Cheatsheet (LLM Patterns from a Big Tech Perspective)

This notebook distills years of hands-on LLM experimentation into a **cheatsheet of prompt patterns** ‚Äî built by an AI Engineer aspiring toward **production-level AI systems** like those in Big Tech.

It leverages `flan-t5-base` from HuggingFace Transformers, running **100% free** on Colab.

## üí° Why Prompt Engineering Matters
In companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google, **prompt design** often beats parameter tuning. This repo captures:

- Practical patterns used in LLM-backed systems
- Zero-dependency workflows
- Free-tier deployability (no API costs)

---

## üß™ Patterns Covered
| # | Pattern | Real-World Use Case |
|--|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Zero-shot** | Fast inference without examples |
| 2 | **Few-shot** | Examples embedded in prompt to guide generation |
| 3 | **Instruction** | Task-style commands (great for alignment) |
| 4 | **Chain of Thought** | Logical reasoning & math chains |
| 5 | **Role-based Prompting** | Set persona (e.g., doctor, lawyer, teacher) |
| 6 | **Stylistic/Format Control** | Email tones, formal/informal speech |
| 7 | **Structured Output (JSON)** | Backend-compatible response structuring |

## üõ†Ô∏è Stack
- `transformers` by HuggingFace ü§ó
- Model: `google/flan-t5-base`
- Runtime: Colab Free Tier (no API key, no GPU needed)

---

## üîß How to Run
1. Open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è on each cell to run prompt types
3. Try swapping in models like `tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b`, `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct` (via Transformers or HuggingFace Hub)

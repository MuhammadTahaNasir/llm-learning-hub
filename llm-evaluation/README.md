# 🧪 LLM Output Evaluation — BLEU, ROUGE, Hallucination Checks

This notebook provides a structured way to evaluate the quality of responses generated by your language models. Whether you're building RAG pipelines, chatbots, or summarizers — understanding how to measure response quality is critical.

---

## 📌 Key Metrics Implemented
| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| BLEU   | Measures n-gram overlap between prediction and reference (common in machine translation) |
| ROUGE  | Compares predicted vs. reference text (used in summarization tasks) |
| Hallucination Flags | Rule-based similarity check to detect possible factual drift |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Input: Lists of predicted and reference responses
- Evaluates each pair using BLEU and ROUGE
- Runs a quick rule-based hallucination check based on string similarity

You can easily replace the examples with your own test cases or model outputs.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- `evaluate` (HuggingFace metrics library)
- `rouge-score` for ROUGE-L and F1
- `difflib` for basic hallucination detection

---

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases
- QA system response evaluation
- Summary quality scoring
- Factuality detection for RAG / chatbot pipelines
- Benchmarking fine-tuned models
